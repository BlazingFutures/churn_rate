# Bank Churn Rate Prediction

Welcome to the Bank Churn Rate Prediction repository! This project revolves around predicting customer churn in the banking industry using a commonly employed dataset. The dataset provides information on bank customers, distinguishing those who have left the bank (churned) from those who remain as customers. Here's an overview of the dataset attributes:

## About the Dataset
- **Link**: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shubhammeshram579/bank-customer-churn-prediction
- **Customer ID**: A unique identifier for each customer.
- **Surname**: The customer's last name.
- **Credit Score**: Numerical representation of the customer's credit score.
- **Geography**: Country of residence (France, Spain, or Germany).
- **Gender**: Customer's gender (Male or Female).
- **Age**: Age of the customer.
- **Tenure**: Number of years the customer has been with the bank.
- **Balance**: Current account balance of the customer.
- **NumOfProducts**: Number of bank products the customer uses (e.g., savings account, credit card).
- **HasCrCard**: Whether the customer has a credit card (1 = yes, 0 = no).
- **IsActiveMember**: Whether the customer is an active member (1 = yes, 0 = no).
- **EstimatedSalary**: Estimated salary of the customer.
- **Exited**: Churn status (1 = churned, 0 = retained).

## Repository Structure
- **Data**: Contains the dataset files utilized for training and testing the predictive model.
- **Notebooks**: Explore the Jupyter notebooks for a detailed walkthrough, covering data exploration, preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.
- **Scripts**: Essential scripts for tasks such as data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training.
- **Results**: Save the trained models, evaluation metrics, and any visualizations for future reference.

## Contribution Guidelines
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open issues, submit pull requests, or provide feedback. Let's collaborate to enhance the predictive power of our model and gain deeper insights into bank churn rates.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
